# Skribbl.io but java

## Proposed by Ethan Hu, Sonja Larson, Catherine Liu

Multiple user game. One user will start out drawing on a blank canvas based on a given random word generated by the computer (displayed on their screen). The drawing will then be displayed to the other users to guess the word that the drawing was based on. Other users then enter their answer into an answer box, whoever gets the correct word in the given time gets a point.


**Stage 1:** Proposal

A proposal for a project requires at least three students,
with at least one student from each block! (This will require
you to utilize GitHub and learn about branches, commits, and pulls.)
The proposal must address each of the following:

- [ ] General description of the goal or purpose. What are you trying to make happen or solve? Feel free to design projects which utilize content from other courses (simulations, for example), address and analyze real daata and problems (the environment, anyone?), or have other useful impacts.

_A game where the player makes choices for the main character in the game, who has just become stranded on an island. The player is shown the amount of resources they have at the beginning (randomly generated). There are obstacles on the island, and you can gain or lose resources as you try to survive the game. If you survive for 2 weeks, the safety boat will arrive._

- [ ] Anticipated file structure (i.e. what classes will you write, where will the `main` method exist? Show me that you have thought enough about this problem or project to begin to recognize some of the complexity you will need to account for.

_A Main.java, Island.java and Player.java_

- [ ] New Java - your proposal/project must require you to utilize some new code structures. This could include learning how to read/write files into a JAVA program, rudimentary graphics, or some utilize some other `class` for your project.
- [ ] Division of labor: who will do what in this project? Is there enough required to justify the time and number of people? This will be the sole task which you will be engaged in during class time, but there is minimal expectation for work outside of class (unless you are not meeting your goals).
