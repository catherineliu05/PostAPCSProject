Multiple users observe a roll of tape on the table. Then, they are given the length of the tape in yards to cut off. 
The tape will roll out on the table continuously (with cm measurements printed on the tape). They will click on the screen when they think they reached the
target length and the tape will cut off at that point by itself.
The person who is closest to the actual measurement (Math.abs) is the closest and gets the point. 

As the player gets more skilled and advances to higher levels (with more complex measurements), they will unlock washi tapes!!

(This game teaches young kids about measurements and the conversion system :D)
